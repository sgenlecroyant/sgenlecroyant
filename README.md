I do the backend with Spring Framework and I am familiar with its related projects such as:

<ul>
    <li>Spring Web: For Rest APIs</li>
    <li>Spring Data: with Hibernate and JPA</li>
    <li>Spring Security: For secure APIs against XSS,DoS attack and many more, </li>
    <li>Spring Cloud: For microservice architecture patterns</li>
    <li>Spring for Apache Kafka: For Kafka integration with Spring Application</li>
    <li>And so on ....</li>

<div>You can't develop a software without testing, right ?</div>
<hr>
<div>Testing is really important in software development since the quality is needed, we can make sure we went through testing phases to get those beautiful promises that we made it 🤣</div>
<br>
Testing tools that I always use are:

<ul>
    <li>
        Unit Testing
        <ol>
            <li>JUnit 5</li>
            <li>Mockito framework</li>
        </ol>
    </li> 
    <li>
        Integration Testing
         <ol>
            <li>Mockito MVC</li>
            <li>Next is Wiremock 😜</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

</ul>

    What about build tools?
<hr>
<p> Well I am using Maven as the project build and dependencies management tool in my everyday life, but I consider giving a try to Gradle in the future. on </p>
